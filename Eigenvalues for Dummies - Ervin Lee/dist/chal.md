# Eigenvalues for Dummies
===

## Description
Eigenvalues are a special set of scalars associated with a linear system of equations (i.e., a matrix equation) that are sometimes also known as characteristic roots, characteristic values (Hoffman and Kunze 1971), proper values, or latent roots (Marcus and Minc 1988, p. 144).

## Hints
1. You first need to transpose the matrix.
2. Can you find a way to brute force through the characters?
3. If column i of the program output happens to be a subset of the possible results generated by a character c, then the i-th byte of the input is likely to be c.
