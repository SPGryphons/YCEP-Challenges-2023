## Description
This your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.<br>
You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to.<br>
You take the RED PIL, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.<br>
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.

## Hints
1. Why is pill spelled like that? Is this guy dyslexic?
2. Focus on the color of the pill that Neo took.
3. Unleash the hidden potential of x and y by fusing their existence into a singular enigmatic entity.
