## Solution
- The flag is broken down into four parts and scattered all over the PPTX file.
- The first part of the flag is hidden in the title of the first slide.
- The second part can be found in the top right hand corner of the slide
- The third part is hidden in the speaker notes of the second slide (You might need to scroll for a bit to find it).
- The last part of the flag can be found on the bottom left corner of the fourth slide.
