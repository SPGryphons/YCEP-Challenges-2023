# Trees
===

## Description
I love trees! Do you love trees? I love trees! I love trees so much that I made a challenge about trees! Because I'm inclusive, some trees do identify themselves as binary. Can you count and search how many of them are there?

## Hints
1. The number of binary search trees within a binary tree can be counted using a recursive algorithm.
