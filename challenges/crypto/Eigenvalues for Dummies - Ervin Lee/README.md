## Solution
- This is a mathematical cryptography challenge involving eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- The solution as per `solve.py` requires the eigenvalues in `eigenvalues.txt` to be transposed.
- Iterate through all printable characters, multiply i by those characters, and multiply 0 through 126 to get all possible results. If column i of the program output happens to be a subset of the possible results generated by a character c, then the i-th byte of the input is likely to be c.

- **solve.py**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from string import printable

# Large prime number
p = 8727242449

with open("eigenvalues.txt", "r") as f:
    enc = eval(f.read())

results = []

# Transpose the matrix
for i in range(len(enc[0])):
    tmp = []
    for j in enc:
        tmp.append(j[i])
    results.append(tmp)

flag = ''

# Brute force the flag
for idx, result in enumerate(results):
    # Loop through all printable characters
    for c in printable:
        # Calculate the possible values
        possibilities = [ord(c)*i*(idx+1) % p for i in range(127)] # 127 is the max value of printable characters
        if all([i in possibilities for i in result]): # Check if all values are in the possible values
            flag += c
            break
print(flag)
```
