1)In this representation, the ciphertext forms a zigzag shape, resembling the Rail Fence pattern. Each letter is placed in the corresponding position to create the shape.

2)To decrypt the message, read the letters following the zigzag pattern from left to right.

3)The Rail Fence cipher employs a zigzag pattern with a specific number of rails.

4)Observe the frequency and patterns of the ciphertext to assist in identifying the number of rails.

*Uses Rail: 4, Offset: 3
