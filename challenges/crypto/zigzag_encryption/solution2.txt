1)Analyse the given ciphertext, which has been encrypted using the Rail Fence cipher with an unknown number of rails.
2)Utilise forensic techniques and decryption methods to decipher the encoded message.
3)Experiment with different numbers of rails to determine the correct configuration for decryption.
3)Submit the flag, which is the deciphered plaintext, to complete the challenge.
