# Robot Conversation

## Description
In a world where robots coexist with humans, there are rumours of the robots planning to erase the human population and dominate the world. Can you investigate this exchange between 2 robots suspected of conspiring against humans?

## Hints
1. Is there a way to convert binary into human-readable text?
2. The password seems to be encrypted using one of the most common and weakest ciphers.
