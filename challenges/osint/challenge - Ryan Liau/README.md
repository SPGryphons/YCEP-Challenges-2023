Solution
1. Look at the picure, you should see northpoint, trace it to the nearest mrt station, Yishun
2. Decode the encoded message that is split into 4 parts found in the file path.txt using base 64 four times
3. Go to google translate to translate the message from spanish to english
4. Count the number of times you decoded from base 64
5. Message should end up like this --> down {4} stops
6. look at the mrt line go down four stops from yishun, and they should end up at Bishan
7. By scrolling down the file path.txt they should see the line "I love shopping"
8. By inference the hideout would be the nearest mall from bishan mrt which is Junction 8
