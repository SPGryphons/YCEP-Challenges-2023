1. Decrypt the whatasillyname.txt file using ROT47. It should say 'MARCH7TH(NOTTHEDATE)'
2. Using the description as reference and googling March 7th, a character wiki page from honkai star rail should show up.
3. Clicking on the link and referring to the flag clue, find the path of March 7th.
4. Omit 'The' from 'The Preservation' and type the flag.
