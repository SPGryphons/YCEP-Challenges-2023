If you read this message, my name is Theodore and I have been trapped in here for 25 years. 

I was banished to the shadow realm by the Gods, and I have been trapped here ever since.

However, I have found evidence of a way out.

There seems to be a [REDACTED].

I might not be here when you get this message, but I hope you can get out.

Good luck.
