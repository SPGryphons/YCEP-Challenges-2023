I have a dream, I'm here to tell
About a wonderful fantastic new hotel!

## Hints
1. Free Hint! I know you didn't learn this at YCEP but you know what they say: get out of your comfort zone and try something new! You may wanna read up about this >>> https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/buffer-overflow/
2. Free Hint 2! Someone dropped their hotel card and it says "H100" on it. I wonder what that means?
3. If you spam a lot of letters, what happens to the output afterwards? Can you manipulate the output in your favour?
