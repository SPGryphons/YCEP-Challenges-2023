# Hazbin Hotel
===

## Description
Inside of every demon is a lost cause
(Ha)
But we'll dress them up for now with just a smile
Wicked smiles~!

And we'll chlorinate this cesspool
With some old redemption flair
And show these simpletons some proper class and style
Class and Style!
(Oh!)

Here below the ground,
I'm sure your plan is sound
They'll spend a little time
Down at this Hazbin Ho-!
