# Anyone Can Cook!
===
## Description
"You must be imaginative, strong-hearted. You must try things that may not work, and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from. Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true – anyone can cook… but only the fearless can be great."

## Hints
1. Programming languages are like recipes. They have different ingredients (syntax) and they produce different results (output). But there is one language that takes this quite literally.
2. Who cooks your food? Hint: It's not your mother, seriously.
