Merchant Simulator 2
===

## Description
Some super big game dev company stole my game and made it pay to win! Luckily, I hid something that can prove that the game belongs to me, but you have to beat the game to get it...

## Hints
1. Apparently this game was inspired by Mega Micro Computers, never heard of them before.
2. I wonder what other games this company has made.
