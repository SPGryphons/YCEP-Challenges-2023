# Ascii71

## Description
There's Base45, Base64, basE91, Ascii85, etc.
I have created my own encoding scheme, Ascii71!
It encodes 3 bytes to 4 symbols, and the alphabet is provided.

## Hints
1. Ascii71 is loosely based on Ascii85 just that instead of 4 bytes -> 5 chars, it takes 3 bytes -> 4 chars, and it divides by 71.
2. See how Ascii85 works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85#Encoding
